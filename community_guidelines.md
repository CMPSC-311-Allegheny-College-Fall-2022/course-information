## Course community guidelines to govern interactions in CMPSC 311 Fall 2022

## Deadline: September 6 at 9:30am

## Activity grade: all students must make a contribution (e.g. commit) to receive credit

### Interactions in class and lab

- be respectful
- respect other's privacy
### Interactions in the local community

### Interactions on Discord

### Interactions on GitHub
 - PRs should be reviewed thoroughly and in a timely manner. Should they not, gentle reminders are okay.
 - Comments and criticism should be respectful and constructive. Provide alternative solutions.
 - Don't sneak feature requests into PR reviews. Focus only on what the intended functionality of the PR is supposed to cover.
 - Branches should follow the naming scheme i.e. "feature/some-cool-feature", "fix/some-cool-bugfix", "doc/some-cool-documentation". The important part being the prefixs of `feature/`, `fix`, `doc`.
 - Commits should be descriptive and small.
 - PRs should be reviewed by at least one other team member.

### Team work
 - GitHub flow should be followed at all times.

### Working with hardware
 - Tools should be shared and not hogged. When you are done with a tool put it back and if someone else needs to use it then finish your task and pass the tool off to them
 - Don't take more than you need, taking the entire box of resistors because you don't know which one you need affects all of us. Take one at a time.
 - Tools are to be put back after you are done using them. If there is no one in line to use them, return where you found them, how you found them.
 - Always wear the proper safety gear required when using a machine or tool

### Violations
- Depending on the severity of the violation, the class will determine the corrective action. 
- Showing up for class late multiple times verbal warning. 
- When work is turned in late JJ will decide on the consequences.
- Exceptions will be made for documented extenuating circumstances.
- Students will report any violations to the professor via [Google Forms] (https://forms.gle/MLevhckE3H1cGmtx8)
