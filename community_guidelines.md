 - Don't sneak feature requests into PR reviews. Focus only on what the intended functionality of the PR is supposed to cover.
 - Branches should follow the naming scheme i.e. "feature/some-cool-feature", "fix/some-cool-bugfix", "doc/some-cool-documentation". The important part being the prefixs of `feature/`, `fix`, `doc`.

### Team work
 - Don't be afraid to hold each other accountable (in a respectful manner).
 - Host brief team reflection at the end of a project to discuss what went well and what could use improvement(This should be respectful constructive criticism).
 - Dont be afraid to ask for clarification for something in a PR.
 - Spend time working out a schedule that all of your teammates can be in the lab/working on the project together.
 - Communicate regularly with your teammates about deadlines and expected workload for each person.

### Working with hardware
 - Tools should be shared and not hogged. When you are done with a tool put it back and if someone else needs to use it then finish your task and pass the tool off to them
 - Don't take more than you need, taking the entire box of resistors because you don't know which one you need affects all of us. Take one at a time.
